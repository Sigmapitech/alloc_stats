/* From valgrind's docs:
 *
 * The GNU C library (`libc.so`), which is used by all programs, may allocate
 * memory for its own uses. Usually it doesn't bother to free that memory when
 * the program endsâ€”there would be no point, since the Linux kernel reclaims
 * all process resources when a process exits anyway, so it would just slow
 * things down.
 *
 * The glibc authors realised that this behaviour causes leak checkers, such as
 * Valgrind, to falsely report leaks in glibc, when a leak check is done at
 * exit. In order to avoid this, they provided a routine called
 * `__libc_freeres` specifically to make glibc release all memory it has
 * allocated. Memcheck therefore tries to run `__libc_freeres` at exit.
